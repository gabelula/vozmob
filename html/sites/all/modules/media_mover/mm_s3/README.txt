There is a S3 test that will let you see if your configuration is setup correctly at: 

admin/media_mover/mm_s3/test

This will attempt to move an image to S3 and then download it.

You need to get the drivers package from here:

http://24b6.net/files/drivers.tgz

this contains the s3 lib and some pear libraries. Place these in your media_mover directory.
