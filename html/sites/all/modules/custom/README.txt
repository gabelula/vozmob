Modules in here are custom modules not hosted on drupal.org.

exif_gps_field_storage: Adds specially-named latitude and longitude fields to the blog node type. This implies that all other CCK blog fields we want featurized should be in this feature too (since cross-feature modifications of the same content type don't work well).  Thus, this module is poorly named.

hastag: Pulls '#tag's out of node title/body and adds them to the node as tags from a taxonomy on that content type.  TODO: should we replace this with the 'hashtags' module? http://drupal.org/project/hashtags

mailsave_to_textpart: Process multiple text parts such as in an mms slideshow.

mm_translation: Synchronizes media mover files across story translations.
