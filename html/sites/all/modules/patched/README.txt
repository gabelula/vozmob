Modules in here are hosted on drupal.org, but needed to be patched.  If the path is accepted and rolled upstream, move the module to contrib.

smsframework:
This has been modified by ekes, and we should think about contributing these back upstream  to the module maintainers.

mailsave:
A number of the cleanup email gateway filters have been changed to keep up to date with changes in the emails sent by providers.

i18n:
Applied some patch from Drupal.org (what issue is this?)

sms_registration:
Changed username/password workflow, added logging to catch registration errors.
